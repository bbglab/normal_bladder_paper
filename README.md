## Reproducibility

### Code

All the code required for regenerating the figures is available here in this repo, and should be run in Python (version >=3.10).
We provide a requirements list that includes at least the required packages for running the codes.

### Data

All the data required for regenerating the figures is available in the following either in this repo directly or in the Zenodo repo : [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15836679](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15836679)

Once downloaded and uncompressed, the absolute path to this data should be use to update the variable `all_data_path` in the `consensus_variables.py` file.

### Data access

Note that the data for generating some of the figures has been shared in an aggregated manner for privacy concerns.

The access to specific datasets for 3 panels is still restricted and we are working to provide a processed version of the data that can be used for the full reproducibility of these missing panels. All the code is already available.
